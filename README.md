SDOT
====

This package contains tool to handle
* semi-discrete transport plans (between discrete and generic densities).
* polyhedral convex functions (represented as a max of affine functions).
* power diagrams (that can be seen as a generalization of Voronoi diagrams).

It is highly optimized, in terms of execution speed and memory usage (more on [this page](execution_speed.md)).

It works in any number of dimensions (>= 1).
