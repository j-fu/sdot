Execution speed and memory usage
================================

The most common tools to handle voronoi and power diagrams starts from delaunay (regular) triangulations. Constructing triangulations 

The literature on triangulation construction is extensive and complex. A significant proportion of the literature is devoted to the optimisation of the algorithms, with a number of great results already available. 

The construction of triangulations has been the subject of extensive study and improvement in recent years. There are numerous libraries available for the construction of triangulations in two and three dimensions.
